Admin User (Administrator)
Client User (Parent)
Role & Permission Management (Backend):

Use JWT tokens with a Role-based Access Control (RBAC) model:
admin: Has full control—can manage users, children profiles, payments, check-in/check-out, reports, analytics.
Client: Limited permissions—view and manage own child profiles, payments, schedule.
📌 Detailed Technical User Flows & Architecture
🛠️ 1. Admin User Role & Architecture
Admin Functionality (Backend API Endpoints):
/api/admin/check-in (POST):

Verify parent/child check-in time. Mark attendance.
/api/admin/check-out (POST):

Mark child check-out time, logging attendance.
/api/admin/users (CRUD endpoints):

Create/update/delete parents & child records.
/api/admin/payments:

Manage payments. Validate payments made, view outstanding payments, mark payments complete.
/api/admin/schedule:

View and manage daily, weekly, and monthly schedules.
Admin Frontend Page (React.js):
Dashboard Overview:
Quickly check-ins/check-outs (attendance).
Payment statuses (due/paid).
Add new families, children, manage profiles.
Reports and analytics (basic attendance stats, capacity utilization, upcoming payments).
👨‍👩‍👧 2. Parent User Role & Frontend Architecture
A. Frontend Profile Structure for Parents (React Components)
Parent view would include:

List of Child Profiles (cards):

jsx
Copy code
<ChildCard key={childId}>
  - Child's Name
  - Short Description
  - Profile Picture (optional)
  - Click to expand detailed profile
</ChildCard>
"Add New Child" Button at the bottom to trigger modal/form:

jsx
Copy code
<AddChildButton />
Detailed Child Profile View:
After clicking a child card, the parent sees:

jsx
Copy code
<ExpandedChildProfile>
  - Child’s Picture (optional)
  - Detailed Description (editable by parent)
  - Schedule Calendar View (future bookings)
  - Payment History Section (paid/due)
  - Contact Info (Admin contact details for queries)
</ChildProfile>
Data fetched from API endpoint:
/api/children/:childId
/api/bookings/:childId
/api/payments/:childId
📱 2. Client (Parent) User Role & Architecture
Client (Parent) Functionality API endpoints:
/api/auth/register (Registration & secure QR generation)
/api/children (POST/GET/PUT) (CRUD operations)
/api/bookings (CRUD bookings)
/api/payments (POST, initiate payments—integrate Stripe or PayPal free tier, or manual validation)
Detailed Client Frontend Structure:
Parent Dashboard (/dashboard):
Child profile cards (as described above)
Button to Add new child (POST /children endpoint)
Secure file uploads (driver license, encrypted storage)
Option to scan QR code for quick secure login or security checks
🔒 Detailed QR Code-based Security (Extra Security Layer)
Backend QR Token Generation:

Generate secure token:
javascript
Copy code
const crypto = require('crypto');

function generateSecureToken() {
  return crypto.randomBytes(32).toString('hex');
}
Store the secure token linked to userId.

Frontend generates QR (using React QR Code):

jsx
Copy code
import QRCode from "react-qr-code";

<QRCode value={`https://appdomain.com/auth?userId=${userId}&token=${secureToken}`} />
Validate token when scanning (backend endpoint checks DB-stored token).
💾 Database Schema (Free PostgreSQL)
sql
Copy code

🔒 Security Enhancements (Entirely Free):
QR-Based Extra Security

Each parent receives unique generated tokens, represented in QR codes.
Scanning QR code verifies identity, authenticates parent securely.
Encrypted Storage (Sensitive data: driver's license)

Use Node.js crypto module or Python cryptography module.
Store encrypted data in PostgreSQL securely.
